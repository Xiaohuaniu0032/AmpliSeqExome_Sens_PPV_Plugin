Leveraging the ultra-high multiplex PCR approach of Ion AmpliSeq&trade; technology along with the Ion Proton&trade; Sequencer, the Ion AmpliSeq&trade; Exome Kit allows for rapid sequencing of key exonic regions of the genome, going from DNA to variants in just 2 days.  The Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome Panel (Hi-Q) ships with a smaller, high-confidence exome BED file. \r\n<a href=\"https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A38262?SID=srch-srp-A38262\">Learn more<img src=\"/resources/images/linkout.png\" style=\"display:inline;margin:0\"/><\/a>&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0018645_HiQ_EffectiveRegionsFile_UB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">MAN0018645<img src=\"/resources/images/linkout.png\" style=\"display:inline;margin:0\"/><\/a>\r\n        <\/td>\r\n    <\/tr>\r\n<\/table>","amplicons_coverage_summary":95.688,"type":"FIXED_PANEL","results_uri":"/ws/tmpldesign/50055032/download/results","pipeline":"DNA","target_size":34998459,"genome":"hg19","min_number_amplicons_per_pool":24491,"number_of_amplicons":293903,"solution_name":null,"genome_reference":null,"design_id":"ExomeHiQ","fusion_type":null,"id":50055032,"created_date":"2014-12-23T14:29:50.096+0000","plan":{"3.6":{"inputDna":"120 ng","designed_bed":"AmpliSeqExome.20141113.designed.bed","runType":"AMPS_DNA","fusion_designed_bed":null,"coverage_detail":"AmpliSeqExome.20130612.results_coverage_details.csv","hotspot_bed":null,"missed_bed":"AmpliSeqExome.20131001.missed.bed","submitted_bed":"AmpliSeqExome.20131001.submitted.bed","coverage_summary":"AmpliSeqExome.20130612.results_coverage_summary.csv","primer_sequences":null,"variant_caller":null,"target_mutations":null,"well_plate_data":null,"displayedPanelSize":null,"primer_bed":null}},"status":"ORDERABLE"}
